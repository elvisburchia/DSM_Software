Digital soil mapping (DSM) is extremely important, because knowledge of soil condition is a prerequisite for appropriate soil protection and sustainable cultivation. For this reason a program in R, based on DSM methods was developed. DSM turns pointwise soil surveys into continuous maps through robust regression and interpolation methods, which selected are the Random Forest regressionand the Ordinary Kriging interpolation. The program can predict any continuous chemical soil properties (e.g. SOM, pH, etc.) with the use of several predictors (e.g. aspect, slope, etc.). High resolution soil property maps, which are the final output, can fill knowledge gaps of detailed spatially-distributed information of chemical soil parameters in any areas.

Before running the R-script ("dsm.R") read the instruction manual ("Burchia_DSM_Instruction_Manual.pdf"). This document explains the method used, how the input data should be, some necessary program changes in R and an explanation of the outputs.
